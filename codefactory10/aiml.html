		Artificial Intelligence (AI):<br>
			AI involves the creation of algorithms and systems that can simulate human cognitive functions such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. It can be broadly divided into two categories: Narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks like voice recognition or image analysis, and General AI, an aspirational goal where machines possess the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.
			<br>
		Machine Learning (ML)
			<br>ML is a subset of AI focused on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and improve over time. Rather than being explicitly programmed to perform a task, ML models are trained on large datasets and can make predictions or decisions based on the patterns and relationships they identify within the data. ML is categorized into several types, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

	<p class="p1">BTech Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is primarily a 4-year undergraduate degree program, provided in the Engineering stream. The student under BTech Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is required to write the code of the said machine. This code in essence works as guiding instruction for the machine, they said the machine is performing tasks with less human intervention.

		Students pursuing BTech Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning would be taught Mathematics and Physics in modular forms during their first few semesters, afterwards, the program will shift towards subjects that are at the core of AI. Top BTech AI and ML universities are IIT Hyderabad, VIT and Chandigarh University. The annual average fees for BTech Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning stand around 1-2 Lakhs per annum. Supreme companies like Oracle, Wipro, and TCS offer placements to the graduates of this course. </p>
	<p class="p1">Graduates of B.Tech in artificial intelligence and machine learning are still required and their need is only bound to increase. In order to be eligible for opting for this 4-year undergraduate course, firstly, the student must have cleared their 10+2 Matric exams from a recognized board; secondly, they must have passed their exams with Mathematics and Physics as their compulsory subjects. The last requirement may vary as different institutes have varied cut off and entrance criteria for students</p>
