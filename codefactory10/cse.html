	<h2><b>OVERVIEW</b></h2>
	<p class="p1">
		Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is a dynamic field that encompasses the design, development, and application of computer systems and software. It integrates principles from both computer science, which focuses on software, algorithms, and data structures, and computer engineering, which emphasizes hardware, microprocessors, and circuit design.At its core, CSE aims to solve complex problems by leveraging computational power and innovative technologies. This field includes areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, database management, and networking. In AI and machine learning, engineers develop systems that can learn and make decisions, transforming industries from healthcare to finance. Cybersecurity focuses on protecting systems and data from malicious attacks, ensuring privacy and integrity.CSE professionals work on creating efficient algorithms, optimizing software performance, and designing robust hardware architectures. They contribute to advancements in robotics, autonomous systems, and the Internet of Things (IoT), which interconnects devices to improve automation and data exchange.The discipline also emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration, merging insights from mathematics, electrical engineering, and cognitive science to innovate and address real-world challenges. As technology continues to evolve, the role of CSE becomes increasingly vital in shaping the future, driving progress in various sectors and enhancing the quality of life.</p>
